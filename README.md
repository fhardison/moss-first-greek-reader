# Moss's First Greek Reader 

A digitization of main text Moss's First Greek Reader with the addition of Alpheios reading tools for the online version. Hopefully a lemmatized text and a digitization of the lexicon can be done later.

This text is being prepared as part of the [Greek Learner Texts Project](https://greek-learner-texts.org/).
